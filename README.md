# Minecraft Bot Manager

This is a simple Minecraft Bot Manager that allows you to automatically connect multiple bots to a Minecraft server. The bot manager allows you to specify the server IP address, port, and number of bots you want to connect. Each bot will be given a random name, and it will automatically run the registration and login commands when connecting to the server.

*Warning: This bot manager is intended for educational purposes only. Do not use it for malicious activities such as spamming, hacking, or disrupting Minecraft servers. By using this script, you agree to use it responsibly and in compliance with all applicable laws and server policies.*

### Features
Customizable server IP and port: Input the IP address and port of the Minecraft server you wish to connect the bots to.

Bot creation and registration: Random bot names are generated, and the bots will automatically register and log in.

Multiple bots: You can specify the number of bots to connect to the server.

Logs and messages: Displays detailed logs for each bot's actions, including messages received in chat.
